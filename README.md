# Object_Detection
Object Detection using OpenCV

I have made an Object Detection using OpenCV which can detect many of the objects in real time

I have used ssd_mobilenet because it can detect objects with accuracy and can run in CPU as well

Dataset i have used is coco_names and it contains the list of classes which we can detect using our Object-Detection Model
